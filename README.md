# Description:
This is a recipe API built with Django, DRF and Python. The API is dockerized with Github actions and workflows. 
The API takes advantage of the Django built-in authentication system and extends it. The default Django login with username and password was replaced with login with email address and password. For better documentation, the API uses the Swagger Open API documentation, although you could still use the default Django Rest Framework API templates. Finally, the API was deployed on Amazon EC2, an Amazon AWS service. You can check it out on this url: https://ec2-52-91-166-79.compute-1.amazonaws.com/ If you accessing this link in the future and it's not available, just know that I have deleted or stopped this EC2 instance as I dont want Amazon to be charging me. ðŸ¤“
